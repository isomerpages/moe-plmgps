##### **Creed**

  

I would be true for there are those who trust me  
I would be pure for there are those who care  
I would be strong for there is much to suffer  
I would be brave for there is much to dare (2x)  

I would be friend of all - the foe, the friendless  
I would be giving and forget the gift  
I would be humble, for I know my weakness;  
I would look up and love and laugh and lift (2x)  

I would be prayerful through each busy moment  
I would be constantly in touch with God  
I would be tuned to hear his slightest whisper  
I would have faith to tread the path Christ trod. (2x)

**We have adopted the words of the hymn written by Howard Walter as our creed. The words embody the ideals and standards the school has set for our pupils. In every line, there is high idealism and a challenge to courageous living. The school creed is sung on alternate Fridays before school starts.**


  

##### **Anthem**

O Let our youthful voices ring  
With all their joyfulness  
In praise and gladness let us sing  
Of Paya Lebar MGS (2x)  

  

Here may we seek all wisdom, truth  
And ways of kindliness  
Through all the years of golden youth  
At Paya Lebar MGS (2x)  

  

So when we leave its sheltering walls  
We go with fearlessness  
Enriched to face life's greatest call  
By Paya Lebar MGS (2x)

  

Lord bless our school our dear PLMGS  
With peace and love and joy and grace  
Our PL-Lites we send to lead and bless  
From Paya Lebar MGS (2x)

  

Now let us pray and learn and trust and obey  
To serve Him in every way  
Glory to God we give and pray  
For Paya Lebar MGS (2x)Â
