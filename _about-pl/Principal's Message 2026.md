<p>Dear Students, Parents, and Friends of PL</p>
<p>As we proudly celebrate our 110<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2026, it is
with a profound sense of thanksgiving and hope that I lead a school community
so deeply committed to nurturing young minds and building character. This
milestone year, guided by our theme “One Perfect 10 in Christ,” reminds
us that our strength lies in our unity and shared purpose.</p>
<p>At the heart of our mission is a simple, powerful belief: every PL-Lite
can be nurtured into a whole person who lives in favour with God and man.
We are dedicated to delivering a holistic education that balances rigorous
academic challenges with rich opportunities in the arts, sports, and character
development. We strive to produce women of fine character a passion for
life and learning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This journey is a partnership. We strongly encourage parent-teacher collaboration
and open communication, knowing that a united community is the foundation
for a child’s success. Our anniversary theme verse from 1 Corinthians 12:12
beautifully illustrates this: “Just as a body, though one, has many parts,
but all its parts form one body, so it is with Christ.” Each student, parent,
teacher, staff member and stakeholder is a vital part of our school ‘body,’
working in harmony to support, challenge, and uplift one another. Like
a beacon, we shine brightly in the community around us.</p>
<p>We also place great emphasis on values and discipline, fostering a culture
of respect, integrity, kindness and thankfulness grounded in our faith.
Our goal is to develop not only successful learners but also responsible
citizens and compassionate leaders who will make a positive difference.</p>
<p>As we honor 110 years of legacy, we look forward to the future with optimism
and joyfulness. Thank you for entrusting us with your child’s education.
I invite you to be our partner in educating PL-Lites and the school is
excited to work with you to make this a year of tremendous growth, discovery,
and togetherness.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Joyce Ang</p>
<p>Principal</p>
