<p>Dear Parents</p>
<p>PL embarked on the first phase of e21cc initiative as part of the Future
of Learning and 2025 will see further consolidation as we prepare to leverage
EdTech to make learning engaging and purposeful for our PL-Lites. Our focus
continues to be on the holistic development of students through our CCE
and total curriculum anchored on Joyfulness@PL. We endeavour to help each
PL-Lite thrive and grow into a woman of fine character with a passion for
life and learning, anchored on our H.E.A.R.T values (<strong>H</strong>onour
God, <strong>E</strong>xcellence, <strong>A</strong>daptability, <strong>R</strong>espect, <strong>T</strong>hankfulness).</p>
<p>The school theme for 2025 is “<strong>Friend of All</strong>”, which is
inspired by Stanza 2 of the School Creed:</p>
<p><em>Stanza 2</em>
</p>
<p><em>I would be friend of all, the foe, the friendless</em>
</p>
<p><em>I would be giving and forget the gift</em>
</p>
<p><em>I would be humble for I know my weakness</em>
</p>
<p><em>I would look up and love and laugh and lift.</em>
</p>
<p>The theme reiterates the school’s common languages of SPARK joy (peer
supporter) and SMILE (etiquette for collaborative learning) and the theme
verse from Proverbs 17:17 a “A friend loves at all times” will be a constant
reminder to be a beacon of light to everyone around us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trademark of the PL family is togetherness and regardless of our diverse
backgrounds, we will continue to ‘Look Up and Lift Up’ in our endeavour
to co-create precious memories and joyfulness at PL.</p>
<p>Our team of dedicated staff will continue to work with parents, stakeholders
and external partners to help each PL-Lite attain her personal best. With
the HEART work and smiling eyes of the teachers as well as the support
from parents, our girls will flourish in PL and take flight to new heights.</p>
<p>In Partnership</p>
<p>Mrs Joyce Ang</p>
<p>Principal</p>
