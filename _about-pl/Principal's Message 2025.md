###### Dear Parents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

###### PL embarked on the first phase of e21cc initiative as part of the Future of Learning and 2025 will see further consolidation as we prepare to leverage EdTech to make learning engaging and purposeful for our PL-Lites. Our focus continues to be on the holistic development of students through our CCE and total curriculum anchored on Joyfulness@PL. We endeavour to help each PL-Lite thrive and grow into a woman of fine character with a passion for life and learning, anchored on our H.E.A.R.T values (**H**onour God, **E**xcellence, **A**daptability, **R**espect, **T**hankfulness).

###### The school theme for 2025 is “**Friend of All**”, which is inspired by Stanza 2 of the School Creed:

###### _Stanza 2_

###### *I would be friend of all, the foe, the friendless*

###### *I would be giving and forget the gift*

###### *I would be humble for I know my weakness*

###### *I would look up and love and laugh and lift.*

###### The theme reiterates the school’s common languages of SPARK joy (peer supporter) and SMILE (etiquette for collaborative learning) and the theme verse from Proverbs 17:17 a “A friend loves at all times” will be a constant reminder to be a beacon of light to everyone around us.&nbsp;

###### A trademark of the PL family is togetherness and regardless of our diverse backgrounds, we will continue to ‘Look Up and Lift Up’ in our endeavour to co-create precious memories and joyfulness at PL.

###### Our team of dedicated staff will continue to work with parents, stakeholders and external partners to help each PL-Lite attain her personal best. With the HEART work and smiling eyes of the teachers as well as the support from parents, our girls will flourish in PL and take flight to new heights.

###### In Partnership
