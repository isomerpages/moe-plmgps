Dear Parents                                                                         

We look forward to 2023 with anticipation and hope as we have planned exciting learning processes and programmes for our PL-Lites.

The theme for 2023 “Glory to God we give and pray” is inspired by our School Song in Stanza 4:

>Now let us pray and learn and trust and obey  
To serve Him in every way  
Glory to God we give and pray  
For Paya Lebar MGS (2\*)_

2023 brings new joy as we uplift the school to God and trust that He will help all PL-Lites thrive and grow into women of fine character with a passion for life and learning, anchored on our H.E.A.R.T values (**H**onour God, **E**xcellence, **A**daptability, **R**espect, **T**hankfulness).

The theme verse from Matthew 5:16, “Let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” and our theme song “Shine Jesus Shine” sum up aptly how we want all our girls to shine for Jesus through their 6 years with us.

The enriching at PL is captured by our holistic approach to character development which focuses on the girls’ flourishing from Joyful Discovery (P1&2), to Joyful Growth (P3&4) and culminates in Joyful Service (P5&6). We are confident that our girls will learn life-skills and grow into a whole person who lives in favour with God and man.

As one PL family, we will continue to ‘Look Up and Lift Up’ in our endeavour to co-create precious memories and deepen Togetherness and Joyfulness@PL.

Our team of dedicated staff will be always there for the girls and we aspire to partner parents to help each PL-Lite discover her gifts and attain her personal best. With the **HEART** work and smiling eyes of the teachers as well as the support from parents, the girls cannot but flourish at PL.

In Partnership
