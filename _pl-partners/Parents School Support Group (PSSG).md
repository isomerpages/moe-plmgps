Dear Parents,

  

Shalom and thank you for taking an interest in the school’s PSSG!  
  
Studies show that parental involvement in a child’s education is one of the most important factors in raising self-esteem and academic achievements. As such, our aim and focus is to provide support in various ways to help the school achieve its mission, and to imbue in the girls a strong sense of belonging and community.  
  
We support activities such as the Stand By Me reading program, preparing Love Gifts for our P6-ers, and organise the much-awaited Mothers’ and Fathers’ day sales. The PSSG support is also seen during school events and activities that include Chinese New Year, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, Teachers’ Day, Children’s Day, and the various levels’ Sports Days. The school also welcomes our PSSG parents to share their professions and careers to inspire the girls with the Step-In Program. For our Christian parent/s, we have a dedicated and loving group of Praying Parents who come together weekly to cover the school and all who are in it in prayer.  
  
Would you consider joining us? If you are interested to joining the PSSG, please complete the [PSSG Registration Form](https://forms.gle/HUbW7cKRoqXWer617). We look forward to your enthusiastic participation and to seeing you around during the school events!  
  
To God be the Glory!  
  
Serving together with all parents,
