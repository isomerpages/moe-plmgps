<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shalom, and thank you for taking an interest in the school’s Parent-School
Support Group (PSSG).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Research has shown that positive parental involvement plays an important
role in nurturing a child’s confidence, sense of belonging, and overall
development. Guided by this belief, the PSSG partners closely with the
school to support its mission and to foster a strong, caring community
for our girls.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our parent volunteers support and contribute to a wide range of school
programmes and events. These include initiatives such as the <em>Stand By Me</em> reading
programme, preparing <em>Love Gifts</em> for our graduating Primary 6 students,
and organising the much-anticipated Mothers’ and Fathers’ Day sales. The
PSSG is also actively involved in school celebrations and events such as
Chinese New Year, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, Teachers’
Day, Children’s Day, and the various level Sports Days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, parents are invited to share their professional journeys
and experiences through the <em>Step-In Programme</em>, inspiring our girls
to explore future possibilities. For our Christian parents, we also have
a dedicated group of <em>Praying Parents</em> who meet regularly to uphold
the school, staff, students, and families in prayer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond supporting school activities, the PSSG seeks to provide a warm
and supportive space where parents can connect, journey together, and contribute
meaningfully to the school community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you would like to be part of this parent partnership, we warmly invite <strong>parents whose child or children are currently enrolled and studying in PLMGS Primary</strong> to
join us as PSSG volunteers by completing the <a href="https://forms.gle/oN1CJg1m9nbbirbT8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PSSG Registration Form</a>.
Your time, skills, and presence — in whatever capacity you are able to
offer — are deeply valued.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We look forward to serving alongside you and to seeing you around the
school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To God be the Glory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Serving together with all parents,</p>
<p>
