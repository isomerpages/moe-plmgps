<p>Our school's ICT-integrated Curriculum, incorporates Computational Thinking.
InC3 provides learning experiences for development of Skills, Knowledge,
Attitudes and Values (SKAV) baseline ICT standards with New Media Literacies.</p>
<p><strong>Phases:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Basic:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Curate </strong>a variety of resources using digital tools to
construct knowledge, produce creative artefacts and make meaningful learning
experiences for themselves and others.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Intermediate:</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Connect </strong>through clear communication and expression for
a variety of purposes using the platforms, tolls, styles, formats and digital
media appropriate to their goals.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Create </strong>new, useful or imaginative solutions in order
to solve a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Programme Structure:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our InC3 programme is built on 3 pillars of Joyfulness at PL:</p>
