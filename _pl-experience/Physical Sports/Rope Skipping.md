Rope Skipping is a CCA which has been offered in PLMGS (Primary) for almost a decade.   The Rope Skipping team compromises of highly-trained skippers who have taken part in local competitions and performances as well as amateur skippers who enjoy the sport at a non-competitive level.

The competitive team trains at least twice a week. During the training session, pupils learn skills which enable them to skip competently in speed and creative events. 

Besides imparting rope skipping skills to the pupils during these CCA practices, our teachers and coaches also place emphasis on inculcating our school H.E.A.R.T values (**H**onour God, **E**xcellence mindset, **A**daptable, **R**espect and being **T**hankful) in our skippers.
