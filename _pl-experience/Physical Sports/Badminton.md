The PLMGPS (Primary) Badminton School Team is one with great team spirit and camaraderie. To be prepared for the inter-school games, the team puts in tremendous effort and time to be trained in the required badminton skills and techniques such as footwork and smash.   Through the regular and rigorous training, the CCA seeks to develop the responsibility, discipline and sportsmanship in each of her members. In addition, great emphasis is placed on developing leaders with the initiative to guide their team members and juniors through the school values, H.E.A.R.T.
