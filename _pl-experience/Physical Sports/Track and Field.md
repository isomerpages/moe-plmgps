Track & Field is a sport that combines a variety of locomotor skills. It involves training of core muscles that enable the girls to run, jump and throw. Track & Field consists of running events which include 100m, 200m, 300m, 600m, hurdles and the 4 x 100m relay. The field events include long jump, high jump, hurdles and shot put.

In Track & Field, we develop pupils in their athletic abilities and strive to help each pupil scale greater heights in their potential. This is done through rigorous training sessions up to three times a week of training. Pupils gain strength, speed, power and endurance during training and they develop perseverance and team work. They learn to show care for each other during training periods.

Athletes with strong abilities and who display the school values will be identified to represent the school in the annual National Inter-School Track & Field Championships. Mental resilience is developed when they participate in competitions.
