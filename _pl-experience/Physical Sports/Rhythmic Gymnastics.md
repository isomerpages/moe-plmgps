Rhythmic Gymnastics (RG) is a sport that requires the manipulation of one or more apparatus such as rope, ball, hoop, clubs, or ribbon within individuals or teams. It is a combination of ballet, gymnastics, dance and apparatus manipulation. Pupils learn about sportsmanship, teamwork, fair play and dedication through the mastery of fundamental skills. They will be given opportunities to exhibit their skills in national and inter-school competitions as well as performances in school.
