The 2-year PAL Programme for the Lower Primary students aims to provide opportunities for PL-Lites to acquire the knowledge and develop skills and values to prepare them to thrive in a fast-changing world. PL-Lites will learn through fun and varied experiences in:

1.  Sports and Games
2.  Outdoor Education
3.  Performing Arts
4.  Visual Arts

Through these modules, PL-Lites develop social and emotional competencies in the five learning domains (cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical) as they discover about themselves and others as they work together.
