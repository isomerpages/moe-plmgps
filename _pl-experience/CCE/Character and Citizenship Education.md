<h4><strong>OUR INTEGRATED CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Holistic Development Framework is illustrated by a pictorial
representation of a globe to symbolise our endeavour of enabling our PL-Lites
to flourish in a complex and evolving future landscape.</p>
<p>At PLMGS (Primary), the heart of our education is to develop PL-Lites
to be <strong>women of fine character with the passion for life and learning</strong>.&nbsp;
We believe that all PL-Lites must be women after God’s heart where they
learn the <strong>H.E.A.R.T. Values </strong>of Honour God, Excellence,
Adaptability, Respect and Thankfulness, and <strong>discover, grow and serve joyfully, </strong>living
out <strong>Joyfulness@PL </strong>as our DNA.</p>
<p>Citizenship Education at PLMGS (Primary) develops in PL-Lites a deeper
sense of belonging, reality, hope and culminated in the will to act as
they learn to become active citizens who have a collective resolve and
a shared mission towards building Singapore.</p>
<p>Our PL-Lites are also guided by a common <strong>Growth Mindset </strong>language
found in <strong>S.T.I.C.K, S.P.A.R.K </strong>and<strong> S.M.I.L.E.. S.T.I.C.K.</strong> guides
every PL-Lite to be resilient<strong> </strong>individuals who will overcome
challenges and failures,<strong> S.P.A.R.K. </strong>reminds every PL-Lite
to be caring individuals who<strong> </strong>seek to be peer supporters,
and <strong>S.M.I.L.E. </strong>encourages every PL-Lite to work collaboratively
with their peers.</p>
<p>Our Student Holistic Development is anchored on the <strong>3E Approach</strong>:
Equip, Engage and Excel. PL-Lites are <strong>equipped </strong>with the
H.E.A.R.T values, knowledge and skills, <strong>engaged </strong>as they
put into practice the values and skills and<strong> </strong>provided with
opportunities to <strong>excel </strong>through:<strong> Character and Citizenship Education; Effective Pedagogy; Engaging Student Development Experiences; Holistic Assessment; Positive Learning Environment</strong> and <strong>Signature Learning Programmes.</strong> The
foundation of the framework espouses the importance of building professional
capital in our <strong>Engaged</strong>, <strong>Professional</strong> and <strong>Innovative </strong>staff
who are key enablers to quality teaching and joyful learning.</p>
<p>With a strong <strong>Culture of Care and Excellence</strong>, it is our
belief that the six-year education develops PL-Lites to become <strong>confident leaders, creative problem solvers and global citizens, with the agency to meet future challenges.&nbsp; </strong>With
these <strong>future-ready competencies</strong>, PL-Lites will be able
to <strong>create, connect</strong> and <strong>contribute</strong> to their
home, school and community.</p>
<p>The <strong>CCE Curriculum Content Areas</strong> is anchored on the teaching
of core values and social-emotional competencies to help students find
a sense of purpose and is premised on the three big ideas embedded in <strong>CCE Lessons</strong> (CCE(FTGP),
CCE(MTL) and PAL (P1 and P2 only):</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Identity – Who am I?; Who do I want to be?; What does my best self look like?</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships – How do I relate to myself, others and the world around me?</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choices – How do I choose to be?; How do I choose to act?;&nbsp; What kind of future do I want?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>National Education (NE)@ PLMGS (Primary)</strong></h4>
<p>NE Commemorative Days provide opportunities for students to deepen their
appreciation of our shared past and Singapore’s current realities.&nbsp;
Our school seeks to nurture a strong a sense of belonging, a sense of hope,
a sense of reality and a strong will in our PL-Lites to act as citizens.&nbsp;
Besides school wide-commemoration, CCE(FTGP) lessons related to the NE
Commemorative Days are conducted.&nbsp; In addition, the contemporary content
are provided for students through Kindsville Times / A-OK!</p>

<p>In alignment to the school’s vision of being an outstanding school of
choice producing women of fine character with a passion for life and learning,
character education is the heart of student development.&nbsp; With the
opportunities for students to develop character and citizenship, it is
our mission to nurture every PL-Lite into a whole person, who lives in
favour with God and man.&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, PLMGS (Primary) believes
that Character and Citizenship Education is critical in the holistic development
of our students as it prepares them for life.</p>
<p><strong>Our Integrated Character and Citizenship Education Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>At PLMGS (Primary), the integrated Character and Citizenship Education
is anchored on the 3-E Approach: Equip, Engage, Excel.&nbsp; PL-Lites are
equipped with the HEART values, social emotional competencies, knowledge
and skills to realise the schools’ vision through the Student Developmental
Experiences found in CCE (MTL) Curriculum, NE, CCA, Student leadership,
VIA, ECG, Cyber Wellness and Student Advocacy.</p>
<p>Through these learning experiences, PL-Lites will learn what constitutes
good character, be engaged with different learning experiences to practise
the skills before excelling as a whole person. &nbsp;The use of common
languages found in S.T.I.C.K., S.P.A.R.K. and S.M.I.L.E at the class and
school levels as well as working with our parents and partners will further
reinforce their learning.</p>
<p>In addition, PLMGS (Primary) also aims to develop in PL-Lites a deeper
sense of belonging and rootedness to Singapore through the learning experiences.&nbsp;
PL-Lites’ NE experiences are not only created through the four NE Commemorative
Days namely Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony
Day and National Day but also through the curriculum.&nbsp; Learning from
different professionals on how they contribute to Singapore during the
ECG Programme will allow PL-Lites to engage in conversations to understand
contemporary issues in Singapore, her constraints and vulnerabilities.&nbsp;
PL-Lites will also have opportunities to initiate ways to contribute to
the community and nation.</p>
