In alignment to the school’s vision of being an outstanding school of choice producing women of fine character with a passion for life and learning, character education is the heart of student development.  With the opportunities for students to develop character and citizenship, it is our mission to nurture every PL-Lite into a whole person, who lives in favour with God and man.   Therefore, PLMGS (Primary) believes that Character and Citizenship Education is critical in the holistic development of our students as it prepares them for life.

**Our Integrated Character and Citizenship Education Approach**

 At PLMGS (Primary), the integrated Character and Citizenship Education is anchored on the 3-E Approach: Equip, Engage, Excel.  PL-Lites are equipped with the HEART values, social emotional competencies, knowledge and skills to realise the schools’ vision through the Student Developmental Experiences found in CCE (MTL) Curriculum, NE, CCA, Student leadership, VIA, ECG, Cyber Wellness and Student Advocacy.

 Through these learning experiences, PL-Lites will learn what constitutes good character, be engaged with different learning experiences to practise the skills before excelling as a whole person.  The use of common languages found in S.T.I.C.K., S.P.A.R.K. and S.M.I.L.E at the class and school levels as well as working with our parents and partners will further reinforce their learning.

In addition, PLMGS (Primary) also aims to develop in PL-Lites a deeper sense of belonging and rootedness to Singapore through the learning experiences.  PL-Lites’ NE experiences are not only created through the four NE Commemorative Days namely Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day but also through the curriculum.  Learning from different professionals on how they contribute to Singapore during the ECG Programme will allow PL-Lites to engage in conversations to understand contemporary issues in Singapore, her constraints and vulnerabilities.  PL-Lites will also have opportunities to initiate ways to contribute to the community and nation.
