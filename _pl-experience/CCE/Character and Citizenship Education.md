<h4><strong>OUR INTEGRATED CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Holistic Development Framework is illustrated by a pictorial
representation of a globe to symbolise our endeavour of enabling our PL-Lites
to flourish in a complex and evolving future landscape.</p>
<p>At PLMGS (Primary), the heart of our education is to develop PL-Lites
to be <strong>women of fine character with the passion for life and learning</strong>.&nbsp;
We believe that all PL-Lites must be women after God’s heart where they
learn the <strong>H.E.A.R.T. Values </strong>of Honour God, Excellence,
Adaptability, Respect and Thankfulness, and <strong>discover, grow and serve joyfully, </strong>living
out <strong>Joyfulness@PL </strong>as our DNA.</p>
<p>Citizenship Education at PLMGS (Primary) develops in PL-Lites a deeper
sense of belonging, reality, hope and culminated in the will to act as
they learn to become active citizens who have a collective resolve and
a shared mission towards building Singapore.</p>
<p>Our PL-Lites are also guided by a common <strong>Growth Mindset </strong>language
found in <strong>S.T.I.C.K, S.P.A.R.K </strong>and<strong> S.M.I.L.E.. S.T.I.C.K.</strong> guides
every PL-Lite to be resilient<strong> </strong>individuals who will overcome
challenges and failures,<strong> S.P.A.R.K. </strong>reminds every PL-Lite
to be caring individuals who<strong> </strong>seek to be peer supporters,
and <strong>S.M.I.L.E. </strong>encourages every PL-Lite to work collaboratively
with their peers.</p>
<p>Our Student Holistic Development is anchored on the <strong>3E Approach</strong>:
Equip, Engage and Excel. PL-Lites are <strong>equipped </strong>with the
H.E.A.R.T values, knowledge and skills, <strong>engaged </strong>as they
put into practice the values and skills and<strong> </strong>provided with
opportunities to <strong>excel </strong>through:<strong> Character and Citizenship Education; Effective Pedagogy; Engaging Student Development Experiences; Holistic Assessment; Positive Learning Environment</strong> and <strong>Signature Learning Programmes.</strong> The
foundation of the framework espouses the importance of building professional
capital in our <strong>Engaged</strong>, <strong>Professional</strong> and <strong>Innovative </strong>staff
who are key enablers to quality teaching and joyful learning.</p>
<p>With a strong <strong>Culture of Care and Excellence</strong>, it is our
belief that the six-year education develops PL-Lites to become <strong>confident leaders, creative problem solvers and global citizens, with the agency to meet future challenges.&nbsp; </strong>With
these <strong>future-ready competencies</strong>, PL-Lites will be able
to <strong>create, connect</strong> and <strong>contribute</strong> to their
home, school and community.</p>
<p>The <strong>CCE Curriculum Content Areas</strong> is anchored on the teaching
of core values and social-emotional competencies to help students find
a sense of purpose and is premised on the three big ideas embedded in <strong>CCE Lessons</strong> (CCE(FTGP),
CCE(MTL) and PAL (P1 and P2 only):</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Identity – Who am I?; Who do I want to be?; What does my best self look like?</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships – How do I relate to myself, others and the world around me?</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choices – How do I choose to be?; How do I choose to act?;&nbsp; What kind of future do I want?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>National Education (NE)@ PLMGS (Primary)</strong></h4>
<p>NE Commemorative Days provide opportunities for students to deepen their
appreciation of our shared past and Singapore’s current realities.&nbsp;
Our school seeks to nurture a strong a sense of belonging, a sense of hope,
a sense of reality and a strong will in our PL-Lites to act as citizens.&nbsp;
Besides school wide-commemoration, CCE(FTGP) lessons related to the NE
Commemorative Days are conducted.&nbsp; In addition, the contemporary content
