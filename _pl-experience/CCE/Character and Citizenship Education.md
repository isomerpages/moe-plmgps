<h4><strong>OUR INTEGRATED CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Holistic Development Framework is illustrated by a pictorial
representation of a globe to symbolise our endeavour of enabling our PL-Lites
to flourish in a complex and evolving future landscape.</p>
<p>At PLMGS (Primary), the heart of our education is to develop PL-Lites
to be&nbsp;<strong>women of fine character with the passion for life and learning</strong>.
We believe that all PL-Lites must be women after God’s heart where they
learn the&nbsp;<strong>H.E.A.R.T. Values&nbsp;</strong>of Honour God, Excellence,
Adaptability, Respect and Thankfulness, and&nbsp;<strong>discover, grow and serve joyfully,&nbsp;</strong>living
out&nbsp;<strong>Joyfulness@PL&nbsp;</strong>as our DNA.</p>
<p>Citizenship Education at PLMGS (Primary) develops in PL-Lites a deeper
sense of belonging, reality, hope and culminated in the will to act as
they learn to become active citizens who have a collective resolve and
a shared mission towards building Singapore.</p>
<p>Our PL-Lites are also guided by a common&nbsp;<strong>Growth Mindset&nbsp;</strong>language
found in&nbsp;<strong>S.T.I.C.K, S.P.A.R.K&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>S.M.I.L.E.. S.T.I.C.K.&nbsp;</strong>guides
every PL-Lite to be resilient individuals who will overcome challenges
and failures,&nbsp;<strong>S.P.A.R.K.&nbsp;</strong>reminds every PL-Lite
to be caring individuals who seek to be peer supporters, and&nbsp;<strong>S.M.I.L.E.&nbsp;</strong>encourages
every PL-Lite to work collaboratively with their peers.</p>
<p>Our Student Holistic Development is anchored on the&nbsp;<strong>3E Approach</strong>:
Equip, Engage and Excel. PL-Lites are&nbsp;<strong>equipped&nbsp;</strong>with
the H.E.A.R.T values, knowledge and skills,&nbsp;<strong>engaged&nbsp;</strong>as
they put into practice the values and skills and provided with opportunities
to&nbsp;<strong>excel&nbsp;</strong>through:&nbsp;<strong>Character and Citizenship Education; Effective Pedagogy; Engaging Student Development Experiences1; Holistic Assessment; Positive Learning Environment&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Signature Learning Programmes2.&nbsp;</strong>The
foundation of the framework espouses the importance of building professional
capital in our&nbsp;<strong>Engaged</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Professional&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Innovative&nbsp;</strong>staff
who are key enablers to quality teaching and joyful learning.</p>
<p>With a strong&nbsp;<strong>Culture of Care and Excellence</strong>, it
is our belief that the six-year education develops PL-Lites to become&nbsp;<strong>confident leaders, creative problem solvers and global citizens, with the agency to meet future challenges.&nbsp;</strong>With
these&nbsp;<strong>future-ready competencies</strong>, PL-Lites will be
able to&nbsp;<strong>create, connect&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>contribute&nbsp;</strong>to
their home, school and community.</p>
<p>The <strong>CCE Curriculum Content Areas</strong> is anchored on the teaching
of core values and social-emotional competencies to help students find
a sense of purpose and is premised on the three big ideas embedded in <strong>CCE Lessons</strong> (CCE(FTGP),
CCE(MTL) and PAL (P1 and P2 only):</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Identity – Who am I?; Who do I want to be?; What does my best self look like?</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships – How do I relate to myself, others and the world around me?</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choices – How do I choose to be?; How do I choose to act?;&nbsp; What kind of future do I want?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>National Education (NE)@ PLMGS (Primary)</strong></h4>
