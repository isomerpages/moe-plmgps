<p>CW is about our PL-Lites being able to navigate the cyber space safely.&nbsp;
This is done through our curriculum which aims to equip students with the
knowledge and skills to harness the power of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) for positive purposes; maintain a positive presence in
cyberspace; and be safe and responsible users of ICT.</p>
<p>The three principles of Cyber Wellness taught during CCE(FTGP) lessons
are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Respect for Self and Others – Remind PL-Lites to uphold their own dignity
when online and guide them to respect other people to protect their online
reputations (and those of others).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe and Responsible Use – Teach PL-Lites to have an understanding of
the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, inappropriate online
content, and to take steps to protect themselves as well as maintain a
healthy balance of online and offline activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive Peer Influence – Encourage PL-Lites to be a positive role model
online and to advocate positive online behaviour.&nbsp; This includes sharing
healthy and positive content, using technology for good, and supporting
as well as caring for students involved in cyber issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for PL-Lites to act responsibly in cyberspace, they must internalize
the Sense-Think-Act process.</p>

<p>Parents and guardians play a crucial role in empowering and supporting
children to use technology responsibly, respectfully, critically and creatively,
whether it is by ensuring an open conversation with their children, educating
them to use technology safely and positively, or by acting as digital role
models.</p>
<p>Parenting Tips in the Digital Age can be found in the School Diary and
it is important for parents to make a commitment to exercise parental control
on the use of social media to ensure the safety of their child</p>
<p>The CW Tiered Approach is as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
