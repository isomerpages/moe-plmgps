CW refers to the positive well-being of internet users and the CW Education aims to equip PL-Lites with an understanding of online behavior and enable them to be responsible for their own well-being in cyberspace.

  

The three principles of Cyber Wellness taught during FTGP lessons:

1.  Respect for Self and Others – Remind PL-Lites to uphold their own dignity when online and guide them to respect other people to protect their online reputations (and those of others).
2.  Safe and Responsible Use – Teach PL-Lites to have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, inappropriate online content, and to take steps to protect themselves as well as maintain a healthy balance of online and offline activities.
3.  Positive Peer Influence – Encourage PL-Lites to be a positive role model online and to advocate positive online behaviour.  This includes sharing healthy and positive content, using technology for good, and supporting as well as caring for students involved in cyber issues.
4.  In order for PL-Lites to act responsibly in cyberspace, they must internalize the Sense-Think-Act process.

Parents and guardians play a crucial role in empowering and supporting children to use technology responsibly, respectfully, critically and creatively, whether it is by ensuring an open conversation with their children, educating them to use technology safely and positively, or by acting as digital role models.
