<p><strong>PL’s philosophy of Values in Action @ PL is anchored by the following key beliefs:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every PL-Lite can be empathetic creators as they apply the adapted Design
Thinking Skills to make a difference to the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every PL-Lite can be confident connectors as they work together to make
a difference to the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every PL-Lite can be active contributors as they make a difference to
the community</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Values in Action is a learning experience in Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) that enhances students’ development as socially responsible
citizens through having ownership of their contribution to the community.&nbsp;
Anchoring on the H.E.A.R.T. values, each learning experience guides PL-Lites
through the process of forming their identities as they develop social
emotional competencies of Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness,
Relationship Management and Responsible Decision-Making.&nbsp; Being aware
of who they are, PL-Lites form relationships as they work with their peers.&nbsp;
Our PL-Lites are given the opportunity to make choices and have a voice
in what they believe will make a difference in the community.&nbsp; Creating
space for PL-Lites to be heard, students develop self-directedness, responsibility
and ownership of their learning.&nbsp; Their participation in planning
and implementing projects where they contribute meaningfully to the home,
school and external community will develop their leadership competencies,
the sense of belonging as well as the motivation to make a positive difference.&nbsp;
Being actively involved in learning about and appreciating the community,
PL-Lites become informed, concerned citizens of good character by making
responsible choices and contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p><strong>The Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Our PL-Lites are given a choice to make a difference to the community
of concern through:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Action – Doing something to improve the situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awareness – Helping others learn about the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocacy – Inspire others to make a difference</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Values in Action @ PL</strong> allows PL-Lites to apply the adapted
version of Design Thinking – Analyse, Brainstorm, Create (ABC):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A</strong>nalyse</p>
<p>Empathise – To observe, understand and discover the needs of the community</p>
<p>Define – To study the information gathered and define the needs of the
community</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>B</strong>rainstorm</p>
<p>Ideate – To brainstorm, collaborate, share ideas and plan to meet the
needs of the community</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong>reate</p>
<p>Act – To execute the plan, exercise critical thinking and discuss ways
to handle</p>
<p>Reflect – To reflect on learning as an individual / a group through the
following strategy – Think Back, Learn From It, Do It Better</p>
<p>Appreciate – To show appreciation to the people who have helped in the
project</p>
