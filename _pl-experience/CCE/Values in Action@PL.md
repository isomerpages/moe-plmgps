Values in Action is a learning experience in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) that enhances PL-Lites’ development as socially responsible citizens through ownership of their contribution to the community.   PL-Lites are given the opportunity to have a voice in what they believe will make a difference in the community.  Being actively involved in learning about and appreciating the community develops their sense of commitment in playing their part to make it a better place.

  

This learning experience takes PL-Lites on a journey as they form their identities, clarify their values and develop social emotional competencies.  When they know who they are and how they play their part, students form relationships with the people around them in a meaningful and respectful manner.

  

When PL-Lites apply what they learn, they make responsible choices and become informed and concerned citizens of good character.

  

Three ways PL-Lites can make a difference to a community concern:

1.  Action – Can we do something to improve the situation?
2.  Awareness – Can we help others learn about this community concern?
3.  Advocacy – Can we inspire others to make a difference?

  

Six Steps PL-Lites adopt as they put values into action:

1.  Empathise - Discover what matters in our community and share observations, thoughts and feelings
2.  Define - Set goals for the project
3.  Plan – Develop a plan after brainstorming of ideas
4.  Act – Execute the plan; exercise critical thinking when situations occur; discuss ways to handle 
5.  Reflect – Reflect on learning individually/group through Think Back, Learn From It, Do It Better 
6.  Celebrate – Share with others to inspire them to contribute to the community.
