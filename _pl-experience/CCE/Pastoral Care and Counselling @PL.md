The social emotional well-being of every PL-Lite is of utmost importance to PLMGS (Primary) as we believe that all students will have the joy of learning in an environment that is positive and conducive.  The culture of care at PLMGS (Primary) not only seeks to bring about strong teacher and student relationship but also develop a strong partnership with our parents to enrich the social emotional and academic development of our students.  As we meet the different needs of our PL-Lites as they progress through the different phases of their primary school life, it is important for teachers and parents to be equip with the appropriate skills for the right interventions to help them to manage the different issues.  These interventions provided by the Pastoral Care Team comprising of Teacher Counsellors and Full-time School Counsellor, will not only help PL-Lites to manage the situation that they are in but to emerge as stronger individuals who are adaptable and have hearts of gratitude.
