PLMGS (Pri) Handbell Ensemble provides the opportunity for her members to learn to develop their character, musical knowledge and skills.  Handbell ringers are exposed to repertoires of various genres and styles during the weekly CCA sessions. Each of the members will play different notes with various types of handbells and handchimes.

Apart from that, members of the ensemble will also have the opportunity to perform and attend masterclasses and exchange programmes conducted by internationally acclaimed handbell instructors. They will have the opportunity to interact and appreciate the diversity of culture and community through these experiences.

The members of the ensemble also develop in their leadership skills as they lead in simple conducting, team bonding activities and handholding the junior members as they lead in the different sections. 

Through being equipped, engaged and having the opportunities to excel, the ringers are practising the school values (H.E.A.R.T).
