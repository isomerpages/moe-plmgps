The PL Choir places a strong emphasis in putting the school values H.E.A.R.T. into practice.  The members of the PL Choir hone their leadership skills as they take turns to lead one another in various activities such as sectional singing, bonding activities or prayer sessions.

During practice sessions, the members of the choir learn a repertoire of songs, choral techniques and showmanship under the coaching and guidance of their instructor and a professional pianist. Members of the PL Choir are also provided with the opportunities to develop their talents as they attend masterclasses and workshops conducted by renowned Choir Directors.  In addition, as part of their experiential learning, they also perform with other choirs at Choir festivals and public events.

Through these experiences, the PL Choir become confident and outstanding choristers through the pursuit of choral excellence.
