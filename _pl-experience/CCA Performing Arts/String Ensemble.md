The String Ensemble aims to provide talented violinists with the opportunities to perform in an ensemble. Apart from the violin, members may be encouraged to learn to play the viola as well as the cello when they are found suitable to be exposed to these instruments.  The members of the ensemble are also exposed to different genres of music.  Their learning is extended when they are given the opportunities to attend String Orchestra Concerts, exchange programmes as well as masterclasses. They are also provided with the opportunity to excel as they showcase their talents through performances.

Apart from that, the members of the String Ensemble are also provided with leadership opportunities as they lead in their various sections as well as develop a strong sense of teamwork as they learn to make music together.  Hence, being in the ensemble not only allows pupils to learn specific skills and techniques required to play the instruments but also hone the values of respect, excellence mindset and adaptability.
