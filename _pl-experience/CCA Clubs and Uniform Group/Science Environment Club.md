We would like every PL-Lite to have a HEART for the environment. In the Science-Environment Club, we nurture every PL-lite to care, lead and influence the community to build a greener future. Pupils are equipped with knowledge and skills on environmental conservation. 

Activities in the club seeks to :

> 1.      Raise awareness about environmental issues among members of the school community.
> 
> 2.      Cultivate a love for plants and the environment among members of the school community.
> 
> 3.      Educate pupils to take concrete actions that contributes to sustainable living in their own ways.

Activities to help pupils understand their roles and responsibilities as environmental representatives for their school and community are as follows:
