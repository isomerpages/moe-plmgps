The vision of Christian Fellowship (CF) is to nurture and disciple every pupil to be women of fine character. Bible stories are taught and moral values inculcated into them through principles learnt from these stories.

Character building and leadership training are carried out in the weekly CF sessions through lessons, activities and games. The pupils develop leadership skills as they are given opportunities to lead in worship, Chapel, small groups, activities and games.

CF also provides a platform for the pupils to use their talents and creativity to stage the Christmas Play. They acquire organisational skills in the planning of the Christmas Lunch Outreach, P6 Farewell and games. The pupils also learn the values of honour, respect, humility, responsibility, teamwork, patience and caring for one another.
