The Art Club offers pupils with keen interest in the visual arts to come together to learn a variety of art techniques and skills. Pupils are given the opportunities to create artworks using different mediums. Pupils are also encouraged to express their thoughts and creativity through the various art forms (e.g. pencil shading, water colour painting, acrylic painting, pottery & digital art).

There are opportunities for pupils to learn through experiential learning such as going on learning journeys, attending masterclasses as well as develop leadership skills as they take turns to plan, prepare and conduct bonding activities. The Art Club also stresses on the school values (H.E.A.R.T.) during the CCA.
