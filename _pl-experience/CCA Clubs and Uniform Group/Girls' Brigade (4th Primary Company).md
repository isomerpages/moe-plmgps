In the Girls’ Brigade, our mission is to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling her. Our core beliefs are **Every Girl a leader; Every Officer a Servant Leader.**

Every pupil who joins GB will go through the **GB** **STAR Programme.** When the pupils complete the six (GB.J.S.T.A.R.) badges each year, show that they have Brigade and Drill Knowledge and are present 90% or more of the time during CCA, they would be presented with The STAR Award.

Our programme seeks to provide leadership development opportunities for all girls. We desire to develop each PL-Lite so that she can reach her fullest potential. National trainings and programmes such as the annual Junior Leadership Training Camp, Dr Low Guat Tin Challenge and the National Drill Competition all seek to challenge our PL-Lites to grow and become women of fine character. We believe passionately in equipping our GB girls with skills to reach out, serve and make a difference in the community.

Grasp the vision, live the mission!
