#### **Celebrate Our Joyful Discovery & Learning**


  

Dear P1 Parents,

We are proud to present to you **P1 Fiesta 2021 – Celebrate Our Joyful Discovery & Learning** where our PL-Lites have the opportunity to showcase their performances despite the current situation.

Our P1 PL-Lites will showcase their learning and skills through the English Language Choral Recitation based on the Big Books, Mother Tongue Language performances and Coloured Bells performances.

**We seek your full cooperation not to share any videos or photographs on social media platforms.**

Thank you.
