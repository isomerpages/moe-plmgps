##### **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Programme**  



The Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Programme caters to a broad spectrum of interests and talents.  Active participation in our CCA Programme provides that all-round development for PL-Lites. Through the CCA of their choice, they discover their interests and talents as they are Equipped, Engaged and are provided with the opportunities to Excel.  The varied and authentic opportunities also nurture the life-long love for the activity. 


Apart from actively participating in CCA, the sustained participation in any CCA provides the progressive development of CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes.  With that, PL-Lites learn to practise their school values (HEART), Social Emotional Competencies and 21st Century Competencies and competencies that are specific to and general across each activity. Therefore, the entire process would ultimately nurture every PL-Lite to be a woman of fine character with a passion for life as they excel in the CCA that they have chosen. 

In addition, participation in CCA also promotes social interaction across levels as it is a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds.  Through it, PL-Lites develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.

The Primary 3 (Semester 2 only), 4, 5 and 6 (Semester 1 only) PL-Lites will participate in one of the following Co-Curricular Activities offered by the school:
